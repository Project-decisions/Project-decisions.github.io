# About

We focus on making better decisions about projects. 

We do this in two ways:

1. Using *Reinforcement learning* to make decisions that get better as the project progresses

2. Providing sufficient *project analytics* to describe the project.

Projects can be stand-alone, programmes, or grouped into portfolios.
